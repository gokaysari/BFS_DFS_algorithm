# BFS_DFS_algorithm
Breadth and depth first search by using CPP

DFS
In a recursive approach, start at the first node 
and read until you reach the leaf, then store the
nodes you visited in a list, then return to the 
parent and repeat the process until you reach the leaf.

BFS
In a recursive approach, start at the first node 
and read until you reach the leaf, because of the 
priority given in this assignment, first go to the 
top child and continue to go to the top until the 
leaf is reached, then these operations continue to
the left, bottom and right and all nodes are read.
